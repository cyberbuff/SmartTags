One Nation, One Tax, Here It Comes- GST (Good & Service Tax) - Effective 1st July, 2017
What is GST?
	•	GST is a unified taxation system which would end multiple taxation across the states and create a level playing field for businesses throughout the country, much like the developed nations.
	•	It is a multi-stage destination-based tax which will be collected at every stage, starting from procuring the raw material to selling the final product. The credit of taxes paid at the previous stage(s) will be available for set-off at the next stage of supply.
	•	Being destination or a consumption based, the GST will also end multiple taxes levied by Centre and the State Governments like Central Excise, Service Tax, VAT, Central Sales Tax, Octroi, Entry Tax, Luxury Tax and Entertainment Tax etc.
	•	This will lower the overall tax burden on the consumer and will benefit the industry through better cash flows and working capital management.


How will GST help?
	•	It aims to remove tax barriers between the states and creates a single market throughout the country.
	•	The implementation of the Goods and Services Tax Act marks the end of a parallel economy that thrived outside the tax system.
	•	No one can afford to remain outside the GST Network because anyone buying a product from outside the GST Network will not be eligible for input tax credits when he sells it later.


GST Rates
	•	The GST Council has fixed four broad tax slabs under the new GST system – 5 per cent, 12 per cent, 18 per cent and 28 per cent. On top of the highest slab, there is a cess on luxury and demerit.

Benefits Available to SEZ (Special Economic Zone)?
	•	GST is exempted on procurement of goods/ service as Zoho being located in a SEZ area.


So essentially, Goods & Services Tax is going to have a two-pronged benefit. One, it will reduce the cascading effect of taxes, and second, by allowing input tax credit, it will reduce the burden of taxes and, hopefully, prices.
