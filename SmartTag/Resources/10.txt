Congrats to the Top five Contestants…..
Sorry for the inconvenience caused at the final match prediction. 
 
Well FIFA WC is over but we could still continue with playing the game.
So we’ve planned to strike the UEFA Champions League.  We've chosen ISL as our second choice.
Which we should prepare for UCL or ISL or both?
If you think we can end this game here we shall do it.
Share your thoughts so that we can be able to proceed the game process.
 
 
Cheers..!
