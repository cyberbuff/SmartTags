Live IPL dashboards powered by Zoho Reports
It’s that time of the year again!
The IPL fever has gripped the country and with CSK’s re-entry, this T20 cricket season just got more exciting. With 51 days of exciting action spread over 60 matches, it is not the participating 8 cities alone where the fever is at its peak but all over India and even abroad.
From cheering for your favourite team to trolling the teams you hate… it is going to be action-packed and we know that No matter how much we want our favourite team to win the title, the result will be unpredictable.
We, at Zoho Reports, collected the data and let the data do the talking. We present you live IPL dashboards (with stats from 2008-2018, sorted by year/player/teams). You can check the stats across years and find out the performance of your favourite teams and players individually.
