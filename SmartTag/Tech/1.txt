iOS Hackathon, 2018
Dear Apple tech developers,
Time to elevate yourself to participate in the biggest mobile event in Zoho. We're happy to announce the iOS Hackathon to be held on 27th and 28th of July 2018. Register yourselves/your team at https://app.zohocreator.com/ashokr/ios-hackathon/#Form:Team_Registration by 26th July, Thursday before 5:00 pm so that we can take care of your food. 
 
What is iOS Hackathon?
A team of maximum three iOS developers can use Apple technologies/hardwares to derive ideas which can be used in Zohocorp apps. You can either implement those in any existing app or as a standalone app which might be converted as a SDK / framework at a later point of time, based on the app's needs. Teams should submit a presentation with screenshots or a video along with the demo hack.
 
What would be evaluated?
	•	Broadness of the idea
	•	Relevance to ZohoCorp's products
	•	Originality
	•	Completeness of the hack.
P.S: This is not a design hackathon but a technology hackathon. So points will be awarded based on the latter.
